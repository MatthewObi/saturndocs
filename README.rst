About this language
===================

Saturnlang is a new programming language developed as a personal exercise. It is currently far from being feature
rich, or being useful. However, there are plans to add features that could prove useful to developers. One such
feature is making webasm projects easier to make. 

Here is the "Hello, world!" program, written in Saturn::

    package main;

    fn main(): int {
        printf("Hello, world!\n");
        return 0;
    }

Features
--------

- Memory management which is easier to deal with compared to C/C++.
- Clean syntax, but familiar to C/C++ programmers.
- Easier to develop webasm programs (Future plan).
