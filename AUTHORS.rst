I am a full-time student studying Computer Science. I am currently hunting for a job, but in my spare time, 
I'm designing this language. I had an idea for a language like this a few years back, and I had built a semi-working
compiler, although I eventually abandoned the project. However, this time I intend to at least have Saturn in
a usable state.

My main motivation to work on this is due to how convoluted it is to get a working webassembly program off 
the ground without rewiting everything. I wanted to design a compiled language that was easy to port projects
to webassembly. The language has many nicities, but my goal was to make it simplistic so that a programmer can
easily learn it.

It's also an exercise in learning language design and how compilers operate. I've already learned a lot in just
getting the language into the state it already is. And I know I have so much more to learn.
